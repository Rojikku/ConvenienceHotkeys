The EXE is the one you should run, the script requires the program AutoHotkey(which I used to compile/write the script). The script is availible as open source, I suppose, and anyone can use it freely. It wasn't remotely difficult to make so I don't really care. I just am abusing my github out of boredom.

Thanks to AutoHotkey...
I know the program is called AutoConvenience, I just suck at having static names, don't worry about it.
