The EXE is the one you should run, the script requires the program AutoHotkey(which I used to compile/write the script). The script is availible as open source, I suppose, and anyone can use it freely. It wasn't remotely difficult to make so I don't really care. I just am abusing my github out of boredom.

Thanks to AutoHotkey...
I know the program is called AutoConvenience, I just suck at having static names, don't worry about it.

Controls: The clipboards are initialized by ctrl + i, that also resets it.
You can copy anything you want, after copied, hit ctrl + 1-4(any number works, all are different clipboards) to back it up, more or less.
Hit ctrl + 1-4(whatever number you saved it as) to paste it later. You can hit alt + number to erase that clipboard, ctrl + i to erase them all.

As well, it replaces some txt talk with the proper form...
Like w-b becomes Welcome Back (I can't type w-b without the dash because it corrects it as you can see.)

This is a list of everything it converts, copied from the source

::btw::By The Way
::brb::Be Right Back
::bk::Back
::wb::Welcome Back
::ty::Thank You
::np::No Problem
::g2g::Got To Go
::gtg::Got To Go
::w/e::Whatever
::j/w::Just Wondering
::nvm::Nevermind

Also, typing cmdo opens command prompt for you. You have to do it in notepad or google search even, then just hit space or enter and it should open. Depending on where you are.
